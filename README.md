# QnAPlatformBackend
a simple backend for a Q&A Forum called "QnA" where a user would be able to publish a new question, and in-turn other users on the platform would be able to answer the question as well as up/down vote questions. Each question is ranked based on the amount of interaction that takes place with the question based on the metrics(upvotes, downvotes, answers).
